============================
First steps with `Docker`_
============================

My first interaction with Docker was when I started on a new position as a Software developer. Previously I had been working mostly with `LabView`_ for small projects and
the atmosphere was more like of a garage company than of a corporation (with all the benefits that a garage company could give you of courses).
In the new place they used Docker for everything. They liked it so much that they even had a `Docker Image`_ to build their presentation. So was also my first task.
Imagine the situation where I, a guy who come from a company where PowerPoint is the normal tool used for presenting, came to a company where you need to install a Virtual Machine with Linux,
to get Docker installed on it, to run a container so as to build my presentation written in `Restructuredtext`_. My general feeling was confusion. What does this Docker do?
Why do we need it? Why I have to work one week to prepare a presentation that can be done for a day with PowerPoint?

Well, in the next few minutes I am going to try to explain the basic thinks that I consider as an essential for Docker usage.

My first feeling was confusion because I had to
